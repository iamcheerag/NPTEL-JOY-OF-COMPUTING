1.	What will be the output of following program?
	numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
	numbers.append([5,6,7,8])
	print(len(numbers))
	4
	5 - correct number = [1,2,3,4,(5,6,7,8)]
	8
	12


2.	What will be displayed by the following code?
	list1 = [1, 3]
	list2 = list1
	list1[0] = 4
	print(list2)
	[4,3] - correct since reference is same then change in one leads to change in all.
	[1,3]
	[1,4]
	[1,2,3]

3.	What does the function random.randrange(49,150) return in Python?
	It returns a random number from 49 to 150  - correct last number is included in random.randrange
	It returns a random number from 49 to 149
	It returns a random number from 50 to 150
	It returns a random number from 50 to 149

4.	Which of the following options is the possible outcome of the function shown below? 
	random.randrange(1,100,10)
	22
	9
	101
	91 - correct
	
5.	What can be the output of the following code snippet?
	list = [55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
	print(random.choice(list))
	100
	99
	55
	Either B or C  - correct (random.choice select the number from the list hence 100 is not in list to b,c is correct)

6.	If the word in your mind is HIT, in how many ways can you pose the jumbled question?
	5 - correct (3!=6) exclude HIT and makes it 5
	6
	7
	8

7.	How is trimmed mean calculated?
	Sort the values then remove top 10% or bottom 10% of the values
	Sort the values then remove top 10% and bottom 10% of the values  - correct
	Sort the values then remove top 10% of the values
	Sort the values then remove bottom 10% of the values
	Yes, the answer is correct.


8.	State True or False.
		   Matplotlib in Python can only generate line graphs.
	True
	False - False


9.	What is the output of the following matplotlib program?
	
	from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
	x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	plt.plot(x,y)
	plt.show()
	
	A straight line - correct
	A parabola
	A zig-zag pattern
